## Todo List Clean Architecture
This project demonstrates the purpose of the clean architecture, 
alongside with the abilities it provides.

This project is all about the classic todo-list application 😉 
But written in different UI libraries that all share the same
data and business logic layers 🤩

This project is an experiment for my own curiosity, I wanted to test out the clean architecture
when used for multiple frontend frameworks, and also I wanted to write the classic 
todo application without having to create a seperate repo for each framework 🙄

If you are unfamilliar with the term 'Clean Architecture', I recommend reading
some information about what is it and why is it useful. [Link](https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/definition/clean-architecture)
